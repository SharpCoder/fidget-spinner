## What is it

This is a Fidget Spinner made with OpenSCAD. Somewhat unique is the fact that it's actually using a planetary gear system (which doesn't help in any appreciable way, but it looks rad). You can run the code using the latest version of OpenSCAD.

## Parameters

**Sun Gear (1x)** - 45T / 24.0 Pitch / 14.5 Pressure Angle

**Planet Gears (3x)** - 30T / 24.0 Pitch / 14.5 Pressure Angle

**Bearing (5x)** - 6mm (Bore) / 17mm (Dia) / 6mm (Height)

## Assembly

In theory this will be a friction-fit assembly.
